The Binary Extraction and Analysis Tool is a tool for extracting specific information from a binary. Although similar to other tools already out in the field (IDA Pro, Binary Ninja, etc.), BEAT differs from these in one major way. The tool shall only present the user with assembly code specific to the information they desire as oppose to all the assembly instructions in the binary. This will be achieved through the use of plugins.

By default, BEAT will come pre-installed with a network plugin which will help isolate any functions, calls, or information regarding networks. Each plugin will have a library of sorts which will store the common and well-known function calls related to the information desired. The user will have the ability to contribute to the list in order to add information the system may have missed.

BEAT will have two modes of operation, static and dynamic analysis, allowing the user to gain different levels of information on each (e.g. functions for static, registers for dynamic). All the information mentioned so far will be constantly stored in a Database. Once all analysis is done, the user may finally generate a script containing high level code of what the system thinks the binary is doing at the points the plugin isolated
